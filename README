This is a simple app I'm creating as part of an eye health app for an optometrist. There are 4 sections to the total app, but this app simply helps people take a break from a computer screen. You set the number of minutes of screen viewing between breaks, then set the number of seconds the break will occur. Once you start the timers you can cancel or pause them also.
